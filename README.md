# Sia-GPU-Miner
A GPU miner designed for mining siacoins. This miner runs in a command prompt and prints your hashrate along side the number of blocks you've mined.

##How to Use
1) Make sure you have a recent version of Sia installed and running.

2) Run the miner! Make sure the .cl file is in the same directory as your executable!

##Notes
*    Each Sia block takes about 10 minutes to mine.
*    Once a block is mined, Sia waits for 144 confirmation blocks before the reward is added to your wallet, which takes about 24 hours.
*    Sia currently doesn't have any mining pools. A p2pool portal is under development, and can be expected to be ready by the end of the summer.
