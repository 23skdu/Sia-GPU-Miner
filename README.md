# Sia-GPU-Miner
A GPU miner designed for mining siacoins. This miner runs in a command prompt and prints your hashrate along side the number of blocks you've mined.

##How to Use
1) Make sure you have a recent version of Sia installed and running.

2) Run the miner!

##About
When the miner starts, your hashrate will bounce around a bit as the miner tries to optimize itself for your specific GPU.
The miner does a rough search, followed by a finer search to figure out the best way to split the workload on your device. After a minute or two, the miner will finish calibrating and continue to mine!
